## 原文

Fantasy - Gwendolyn Bennett, 1927

I sailed in my dreams to the Land of Night
Where you were the dusk-eyed queen,
And there in the pallor of moon-veiled light
The loveliest things were seen ...

A slim-necked peacock sauntered there
In a garden of lavender hues,
And you were strange with your purple hair
As you sat in your amethyst chair
With your feet in your hyacinth shoes.

Oh, the moon gave a bluish light
Through the trees in the land of dreams and night.
I stood behind a bush of yellow-green
And whistled a song to the dark-haired queen ...

## 译文

幻想

梦中，我踏足夜之地
那里，你化身女王，眼眸中流转着宵色
那里，洒下苍白月光
我看见了世间最美的景色……

那泛着紫色光晕的花园
一只细颈孔雀徜徉其中
你披着紫色秀发
穿着淡紫色鞋子
坐上紫晶王座时
显得，如此陌生

噢，月亮投下淡蓝色的光
穿越丛林
铺在这梦境和夜晚的国度
我站在一丛濒死的灌木后
为那位黑发女王吹奏一曲……
